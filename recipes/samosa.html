            <li>2.5 g cumin powder</li>
            <li>2.5 g fennel powder</li>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Boil potatoes just until done without making mushy.</li>
            <li>Crumble them, do not mash them up. Set aside.</li>
            <li>Mix together flour, carom seeds, salt and oil in a mixing bowl.</li>
            <li>Rub the flour well for 2 to 3 minutes in between the palms to incorporate the oil well.</li>
            <li>Take handful of flour and press down with your fingers</li>
            <li>Add water little by little and mix the flour to form a stiff dough. Cover and rest for 25 to 30 mins.</li>
            <li>Heat a pan with oil. Add cumin seeds.</li>
            <li>When they begin to sizzle, add ginger & green chillies. Fry until ginger smells good, for about 30 to 60 seconds.</li>
            <li>Next add green peas and saute for 2 mins.</li>
            <li>Add red chilli powder, garam masala, cumin powder & fennel powder. Saute for 30 seconds.</li>
            <li>Next add potatoes and sprinkle salt. Mix and saute for 2 to 3 mins. Mix in coriander leaves and set aside to cool.</li>
            <li>Taste and add more salt if needed. if using lemon juice, add it now.</li>
            <li>Knead the dough gently to smoothen a bit. Make 5 portions and roll to balls. Cover the dough.</li>
            <li>Grease the rolling area and then flatten a ball. Drizzle some oil.</li>
            <li>Begin to roll to oval shape of 8.5 inches long by 6.5 inches wide.</li>
            <li>Cut it to 2 parts. The 2 parts make 2 samosas. If the edges are too thick, gently roll it to thin down.</li>
            <li>Take one part and apply water over the straight edge. Join the edges to make a cone. Press down gently to seal the cone from inside as well.</li>
            <li>Fill the cone with potato masala and press down with your finger to push it inside the cone.</li>
            <li>Bring the edges together and seal them by pinching off the edges together.</li>
            <li>After you make 5 samosas, begin to heat the oil until medium hot.</li>
            <li>Gently add as many samosas as you can to the oil and fry them on a low flame undisturbed for few minutes.</li>
            <li>When the crust becomes firm, increase the flame to medium. Rotate them to the other side and fry until crispy and golden.</li>
